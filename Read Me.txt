Hello, each problem solution is done in Java 8. 

To compile & run, please navigate a terminal window to each problem directory.

The combined terminal command


	javac *.java && java Driver
	
	
Can be used in each directory to compile and run the program. By default,
each program will launch with 32 threads and print how long in ms it took
for each thread to complete.
